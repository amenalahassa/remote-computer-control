  - Additional utilities (python-dotenv, pyttsx3, Pillow)

#### 2. Project Structure Initialized ‚úÖ
Created the following directory structure:
```
/src
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py                 # Entry point (basic skeleton)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ discord_bot.py          # Discord bot class with auth checking
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ interpreter_bridge.py   # AI interpreter integration module
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ /tasks
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gmail.py            # Gmail automation tasks
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ screenshot.py       # Screenshot capture functionality
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ /logs                   # Directory for logs and outputs
```

#### 3. Core Modules Created ‚úÖ
- **main.py**: Basic entry point with initialization structure
- **discord_bot.py**: ProductivityBot class with:
  - Discord connection handling
  - User authorization checking
  - Basic commands (ping, status)
  - Logging configuration
- **interpreter_bridge.py**: InterpreterBridge class with:
  - Open Interpreter initialization
  - Message processing pipeline
  - Task execution handlers
  - Built-in tasks (screenshot, open_app, create_file, system_info)
- **Task modules**:
  - gmail.py: Open Gmail, compose email functions
  - screenshot.py: Full screen, region, and window capture

#### 4. Configuration Setup ‚úÖ
- Created `.env.example` template with required environment variables
- Structured for Discord bot token and authorized user ID
- Optional OpenAI API key configuration

#### 5. Documentation ‚úÖ
- Comprehensive README.md with:
  - Project purpose and clarification (local tool, not remote access)
  - Feature list
  - Installation instructions
  - Security information
  - Usage examples
  - Development roadmap

#### 6. Git Repository ‚úÖ
- All changes committed with descriptive commit message
- Project ready for next phase of development

## üõë Current Stopping Point

**Location in CLAUDE.md**: Line 61-75 (End of Milestone 1, before Milestone 2)

We have completed all tasks specified in **Milestone 1: Foundation Setup** and stopped before beginning **Milestone 2: Messaging Layer Prototype (Discord)**.

---

## üöÄ Next Steps (Milestone 2)

According to CLAUDE.md, the next milestone involves:

### Milestone 2: Messaging Layer Prototype (Discord)

1. **Discord bot setup** (Lines 65-68)
   - **REQUIRES HUMAN INPUT**: Discord Bot Token from Discord Developer Portal
   - Configure environment variable for token
   - Update discord_bot.py to connect to Discord server/DM

2. **Basic message listener** (Lines 70-75)
   - Bot listens for messages in specific channel/DM
   - Responds with static message initially
   - **REQUIRES HUMAN INPUT**: Discord user ID for whitelist
   - Implement user ID verification for security

### Prerequisites Before Continuing

Before proceeding to Milestone 2, the following information is needed from the user:

1. **Discord Bot Token**: 
   - User must create a bot on Discord Developer Portal
   - Copy the bot token
   - Add to `.env` file

2. **Discord User ID**:
   - User must enable Developer Mode in Discord
   - Copy their user ID
   - Add to `.env` file for authorization

3. **Bot Permissions**:
   - Bot must be invited to a server or have DM permissions
   - Requires appropriate intents (message content, messages)

## üìù Summary

The foundation for the Local AI Productivity Assistant is fully established. The project structure is in place, core modules are created with basic functionality, and the codebase is documented. The system is designed as a local productivity tool that uses Discord as a convenient interface, with clear security measures to ensure only the authorized user can issue commands.

The next phase will activate the Discord connection and establish the messaging pipeline, which requires user-provided credentials before proceeding.
