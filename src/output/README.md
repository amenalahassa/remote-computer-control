# Output Directory

This directory is used by the AI Assistant to store all generated files, screenshots, and exports.

## Contents

- **Screenshots**: Any screenshots taken by the assistant
- **Generated Files**: Files created through AI commands
- **Exports**: Chat history exports and other data exports
- **Responses**: Long responses that exceed Discord's message limit

## Notes

- All files in this directory can be safely deleted if needed
- The assistant has full read/write access to this directory
- Files are organized by type and timestamp when possible

## Usage

When asking the AI to create files, they will be saved here by default. You can ask the AI to:
- "Create a file in the output directory"
- "Save the screenshot to output"
- "List files in the output folder"
